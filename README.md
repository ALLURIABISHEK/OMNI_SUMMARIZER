# OMNI_SUMMARIZER
Omni Summarizer is a multi-modal AI-powered summarization platform I built using Flask, Python, and front-end technologies. The system allows users to generate intelligent summaries from various content types including text, PDFs, images, and videos.

I integrated multiple vision-language models like BLIP-2, Gemini 1.5, ViT-GPT, GIT, and CLIP to perform tasks such as caption generation, visual question answering (VQA), and multi-model comparisons.

The platform features:

A clean and responsive user interface.

Drag-and-drop support for images and PDFs.

Auto-generated downloadable summaries.

Side-by-side output comparison from multiple models.

Image storytelling using multiple uploads.

Real-time response timers for each AI model.

All the backend logic is modularized, and the frontend is animated and responsive for a professional user experience. The goal of this project was to build an all-in-one summarization tool using the latest advancements in multimodal AI.
